 Hi, my name is Rudra Cantaria. I'm from Toronto, Ontario, located in Canada. I'm studying computer science at the University of Waterloo, which is located in the Kitchener Waterloo area. I play sports for fun. I go to the gym sometimes. It went quite a little bit sudden. And I'm the only one talking now, but I have to get to these 30 seconds. So I'm just going to keep talking. We're here at Hack the North. And if this doesn't work, yeah, we're cut. There you go.Rudra Cantaria is studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. They love playing sports and go to the gym. They are looking for a conversation partner. They want to write a blog about their passion for computers, and share tips or ideas with people.
