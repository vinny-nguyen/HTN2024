 Hi, my name is Rudra Cantaria. I'm from Toronto, Ontario, located in Canada. I'm studying computer science at the University of Waterloo, which is located in the Kitchener Waterloo area. I play sports for fun. I go to the gym sometimes. It went quite a little bit sudden. And I'm the only one talking now, but I have to get to these 30 seconds. So I'm just going to keep talking. We're here at Hack the North. And if this doesn't work, yeah, we're cut. There you go.- I'm Rudra, a student from Toronto, Canada. ... I am studying computer science and play sports, too. How cool is that! ...
